High-Level Overview
The provided repository appears to be a cognitive reinforcement learning project focused on chess, utilizing the Stockfish API and the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. The project consists of four Python files: rl_stockfish.py, game.py, stockfish.py, and chess_game.py.

Module Descriptions

rl_stockfish.py: This module implements the MCTS algorithm, including move encoding and decoding, and a basic MCTS node structure. It also contains code for simulating games and evaluating board positions.

game.py: This module provides an interface to the Stockfish API, allowing for retrieving the best move for a given FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) position and depth.

stockfish.py: This module is a duplicate of game.py, providing the same functionality for interacting with the Stockfish API.

chess_game.py: This module initializes a chess board and prints the legal moves, but its purpose is unclear, as it doesn't seem to be used in the rest of the project.

Key Functionality

Move encoding and decoding using the move_to_index and index_to_move functions.

MCTS algorithm implementation, including node creation, simulation, and evaluation.

Interaction with the Stockfish API to retrieve the best move for a given FEN position and depth.

Basic chess game simulation using the chess library.

Dependencies

chess library for chess game simulation and move manipulation.

requests library for interacting with the Stockfish API.

Execution Flow

The main entry point is unclear, but the main function in stockfish.py initializes a chess board and prints its FEN position, then enters a loop until the game is over, printing the current position and FEN.

Examples

move_to_index function: move_to_index(chess.Move.from_uci("e2e4"), chess.Board()) returns the index of the move e2e4 on the given board.

get_stockfish_best_move function: get_stockfish_best_move("rnbqkbnr/ppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1", 15) returns the best move for the given FEN position and depth 15.
